\textcolor{red}{We present the results of the simulations in the sparse and noisy cases. Figures \ref{fig:logAE_mfd_1d_noise}, \ref{fig:ise_mfd_1d_noise} and \ref{fig:mise_mfd_1d_noise} present the boxplots of the RSE, ISE and MRSE, respectively, for the noisy case. To generate noisy data, we consider the model \eqref{eq:model_error} where $\sigma^2 = 0.25$. For the \texttt{(Tensor) PCA} method, we first smooth the 2-dimensional data using P-Splines smoothing and estimate a smooth version of the mean and covariance functions for the one-dimensional data using P-Splines smoothing. For the \texttt{2D/1D B-Splines} and \texttt{Gram} methods, all the observations have been smoothed using P-Splines smoothing beforehand. In every case, the penalty involved in P-Splines smoothing has been estimated using cross-validation.}

\textcolor{red}{Figures \ref{fig:logAE_mfd_1d_sparse}, \ref{fig:ise_mfd_1d_sparse} and \ref{fig:mise_mfd_1d_sparse} present the boxplots of the RSE, ISE and MRSE, respectively, for the sparse. In this case, we only consider $N = 250$, $M^{(1)} = 101 \times 51$, $M^{(2)} = 201$ and no noise. We consider medium sparsity, where $50\%-70\%$ of the sampling points have been removed and high sparsity, where $90\%-95\%$ of the sampling points have been removed. For the \texttt{(Tensor) PCA} method, we first interpolate the 2-dimensional data to have the observations reguarlarly sampled on a grid and estimate a smooth version of the mean and covariance functions for the one-dimensional data using P-Splines smoothing. For the \texttt{2D/1D B-Splines} method, all the observations have been smoothed using P-splines smoothing with a penalty estimated by cross-validation. For the \texttt{Gram} method, the observations have been linearly interpolated to estimate the inner-product matrix.}

\textcolor{red}{We present the estimation of the eigencomponents of the shooting data using the \texttt{(Tensor) PCA} (see Figure~\ref{fig:eigenfunctions_fcptpa}) and \texttt{2D/1D B-Splines} (see Figure~\ref{fig:eigenfunctions_psplines}) methods. The results are similar to the ones found using the \texttt{Gram} method, for the eigenfunctions and the percentage of variance explained for each eigenfunctions.}
